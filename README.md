# Arabic LLM Benchmark

## Installation
*pip package to me made available soon!*

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qcri/Arabic_LLM_Benchmark.git
cd Arabic_LLM_Benchmark
```

Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .envs/arabic_llm_benchmark
source .envs/arabic_llm_benchmark/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies and benchmarking package:
```bash
pip install -e '.[dev,fewshot]'
```

## Get the benchmark data
Download the benchmark from [here](https://neurox.qcri.org/projects/arabic_llm_benchmark/arabic_llm_benchmark_data.zip), and unzip in into the `Arabic_LLM_Benchmark` folder. After this process, there should be a `data` directory inside the top-level folder of the repository, with roughly the following contents:

```bash
$ ls data/
MT
STS
XNLI
demography
factuality_disinformation_harmful_content
sentiment_emotion_others
sequence_tagging_ner_pos_etc
speech
```

## Running the benchmark
A sample benchmark is available in `assets/benchmark_v1`. To run the benchmark,

```bash
python -m arabic_llm_benchmark <benchmark-dir> <results-dir>
```

where `<benchmark-dir>` can point to `assets/benchmark_v1` for example. The
actual results will be saved in `<results-dir>`, along with intermediate cached values. You might need to also define environment variables such as `AZURE_API_URL` and `AZURE_API_KEY` depending on the benchmark you are running. This can be done by either `export AZURE_API_KEY="..."` _before_ running the above command, or by prepending `AZURE_API_URL="..." AZURE_API_KEY="..."` to the above command.

## Adding a new task
Before adding a new task, make sure you have the latest changes:

```bash
git pull
```

Create a new branch for your task
```bash
git checkout -b feat/sarcasm_task
```

### Dataset
Check if the dataset used by your task already has an implementation in `arabic_llm_benchmark/datasets`. If not, implement a new dataset module (e.g. `arabic_llm_benchmark/datasets/SemEval23.py`), which implements a class (e.g. `SemEval23Dataset`) which subclasses `DatasetBase`. See an existing dataset module for inspiration. Each new dataset class requires implementing three functions:

```python
class NewDataset(DatasetBase):
	def __init__(self, custom_param_1, custom_param_2, **kwargs):
		# custom_param_1/2 are passed from `dataset_args` in the benchmark
		# config
		...
		super(NewDataset, self).__init__(**kwargs)

	def citation():
		# This function returns a string with the bib entry for the dataset

	def load_data(self, data_path):
		# This function loads the data and _must_ return a list of
		# dictionaries, where each dictionary has atleast two keys
		#   "input": this will be sent to the prompt generator
		#   "label": this will be used for evaluation
```

Once the `Dataset` is implemented, export it in `arabic_llm_benchmark/datasets/__init__.py`.

### Task
Check if the task you are adding to the benchmark already has an implementation in `arabic_llm_benchmark/tasks`. If not, implement a new dataset module (e.g. `arabic_llm_benchmark/tasks/Sarcasm.py`), which implements a class (e.g. `SarcasmTask`) which subclasses `TaskBase`. See an existing task module for inspiration. Each new task class requires implementing two functions:

```python
class NewTask(TaskBase):
	def __init__(self, custom_param_1, custom_param_2, **kwargs):
		# custom_param_1/2 are passed from `task_args` in the benchmark
		# config
		...
		super(NewTask, self).__init__(**kwargs)

	def evaluate(self, true_labels, predicted_labels):
		# This function gets two lists, the `true_labels` from the
		# dataset loader, and `predicted_labels` from the
		# post_process function
```

Once the `Task` is implemented, export it in `arabic_llm_benchmark/tasks/__init__.py`.

### Model
Next, check if the model you are trying to run the benchmark for has an implementation in `arabic_llm_benchmark/models`. If not, implement a new model module (e.g. `arabic_llm_benchmark/models/QARiB.py`), which implements a class (e.g. `QARiBModel`) which subclasses `ModelBase`. See an existing model module for inspiration. Each new model class requires implementing two functions:

```python
class NewModel(TaskBase):
	def __init__(self, custom_param_1, custom_param_2, **kwargs):
		# custom_param_1/2 are passed from `model_args` in the benchmark
		# config
		...
		super(NewModel, self).__init__(**kwargs)

	def prompt(self, **kwargs):
		# This function gets the pre-processed input and must
		# run the actual model and return model outputs
```

Once the `Model` is implemented, export it in `arabic_llm_benchmark/models/__init__.py`.

### Benchmark Asset
Now that the Dataset, Task and Model are defined, the framework expects a given benchmark asset (e.g. "ArabGender" dataset, "GenderClassification" task, "GPT" model and "ZeroShot" prompting setting) to have a `*.py` file with three functions:

```python
def config():
	# This function returns a dictionary with the dataset, task and model the
	# current run is targeting along with arguments for each of these, as well
	# as a path to the dataset itself.

def prompt(input_sample):
	# This function receives an input_sample and pre-processes it into the
	# expected input for the model being uses. For instance, GPTModel expects
	# its input to be a dictionary with two keys, ``system_message`` and a list
	# of ``messages`` with the ``sender`` and ``text`` in each message.
	# See the documentation linked with the available models for exact specifications

def post_process(response):
	# This function takes the output from the model, and post-processes it to
	# extract the actual prediction. The framework expects this function to
	# return one of the labels (or None if the model output cannot be parsed
	# into a label). The output of the function is matched with the gold label
	# in a task's evaluation function.
```

### Testing
The benchmarking module allows one to run a specific asset instead of the entire benchmark using the `--filter` option. It is also a good idea to use the `--limit` option to limit the tests to few (e.g. 5 samples). Sample command below:

```bash
python -m arabic_llm_benchmark --filter 'demography/gender/AraGend_ChatGPT_ZeroShot' --limit 5 <benchmark-dir> <results-dir>
```

Make sure to also run `scripts/run_tests.sh` before submitting your code, and once you are ready, you can commit your changes locally and push them to a remote branch:

```bash
git push origin feat/sarcasm_task
```

and open a _pull request_ by going to the [repository webpage](https://github.com/qcri/Arabic_LLM_Benchmark)
