# LLMeBench: A Flexible Framework for Accelerating LLMs Benchmarking

This repository contains code for the [LLMeBench framework](https://youtu.be/FkQn4UjYA0s?feature=shared) (described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04945" target="_blank">this paper</a>). The framework currently supports evaluation of a variety of NLP tasks using [OpenAI's GPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt) and [BLOOMZ](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz) models; it can be seamlessly customized for any NLP task, LLM model and dataset, regardless of language.

- LLMeBench currently supports 31 [tasks](llmebench/tasks) featuring 3 [models](llmebench/models). Tested with 53 [datasets](llmebench/datasets) associated with 12 languages, resulting in over **190 [becnhamrking assets](assets/benchmark_v1)** ready to run.
- Easly extensible to new models accessible through APIs.
- Extensive caching capabilities, to avoid costly API re-calls for repeated experiments.
- Supports zero- and few-shot learning paradigms.
- Open-source.

## Quick Start!
1. [Install](https://github.com/qcri/LLMeBench/tree/readme_update1#installation) LLMeBench.
2. [Get the data](https://github.com/qcri/LLMeBench/tree/readme_update1#get-the-benchmark-data).
3. Evaluate!
   
   For example, to evaluate the performance of a [random baseline](llmebench/models/RandomGPT.py) for Sentiment analysis on [ArSAS dataset](llmebench/datasets/ArSAS.py), you need to create an ["asset"](assets/benchmark_v1/sentiment/sentiment/ArSAS_Random.py): a file that specifies the dataset, model and task to evaluate, then run the evaluation as follows:
   ```bash
   python -m llmebench --filter '*ArSAS_Random*' assets/ar/sentiment_emotion_others/sentiment/ results/ 
   ```
   where `ArSAS_Random` is the asset name refering to the `ArSAS` dataset name and the `Random` model, and `assets/ar/sentiment_emotion_others/sentiment/` is the directory where the asset for the sentiment analysis task on Arabic ArSAS dataset can be found. Results will be saved in a directory called `results`. 

## Installation
*pip package to be made available soon!*

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qcri/LLMeBench.git
cd LLMeBench
```

Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .envs/llmebench
source .envs/llmebench/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies and benchmarking package:
```bash
pip install -e '.[dev,fewshot]'
```

## Get the benchmark data
Download the benchmark from [here](https://neurox.qcri.org/projects/llmebench/arabic_llm_benchmark_data.zip), and unzip it into the `Arabic_LLM_Benchmark` folder. After this process, there should be a `data` directory inside the top-level folder of the repository, with roughly the following contents:

```bash
$ ls data/
MT
STS
XNLI
demography
factuality_disinformation_harmful_content
sentiment_emotion_others
sequence_tagging_ner_pos_etc
speech
```

## Usage
To run the benchmark,

```bash
python -m llmebench --filter '*benchmarking_asset*' --limit <k> --n_shots <n> --ignore_cache <benchmark-dir> <results-dir> 
```

#### Parameters
- `--filter '*benchmarking_asset*'`: **(Optional)** This flag indicates specific tasks in the benchmark to run. The framework will run a wildecard search using '*benchmarking_asset*' in the assets directory specified by `<benchmark-dir>`. If not set, the framework will run the entire benchmark.
- `--limit <k>`: **(Optional)** Specify the number of samples from input data to run through the pipeline, to allow effecient testing. If not set, all the samples in a dataset will be evaluated.
- `--n_shots <n>`: **(Optional)** If defined, the framework will expect a few-shot asset and will run the few-shot learning paradigm, with `n` as the number of shots. If not set, zero-shot will be assumed.
- `--ignore_cache`: **(Optional)** A flag to ignore loading and saving intermediate model responses from/to cache. 
- `<benchmark-dir>`: Path of the directory where the benchmarking assets can be found.
- `<results-dir>`: Path of the directory where to save output results, along with intermediate cached values.
- You might need to also define environment variables (like access tokens and API urls, e.g. `AZURE_API_URL` and `AZURE_API_KEY`) depending on the benchmark you are running. This can be done by either:
   - `export AZURE_API_KEY="..."` _before_ running the above command, or
   - prepending `AZURE_API_URL="..." AZURE_API_KEY="..."` to the above command.

#### Outputs format
- `<results-dir>`: The framework will create a sub-folder per benchmarking asset in this directory. A sub-folder will contain:
  - **_n.json_**: A file per dataset sample, where *n* indicates sample order in the dataset input file. This file contains input sample, full prompt sent to the model, full model response, and the model output after post-processing as defined in the asset file.
  - **_summary.jsonl_**: Lists all input samples that successfuly ran through the pipeline, and for each, the raw model prediction, and the post-processed model prediction.
  -  **_summary_failed.jsonl_**: Lists all input samples that didn't get a successful response from the model, in addition to output model's reason behind failure.
  -  **_results.json_**: Contains a summary on number of processed and failed input samples, and evaluation results.

#### Caching
The framework provides caching (if `--ignore_cache` isn't passed), to enable the following: 
- Allowing users to bypass making API calls for items that have already been successfully processed.
- Enhancing the post-processing of the modelsâ€™ output, as post-processing can be performed repeatedly without having to call the API every time. 

#### Running Few Shot Assets
The framework has some preliminary support to automatically select `n` examples _per test sample_ based on a maximal marginal relevance-based approach (using [langchain's implementation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/example_selectors/mmr)). This will be expanded in the future to have more few shot example selection mechanisms (e.g Random, Class based etc.).

To run few shot assets, supply the `--n_shots <n>` option to the benchmarking script. This is set to 0 by default and will run only zero shot assets. If `--n_shots` is > zero, only few shot assets are run.

## Tutorial
It is possible to extend the framework by at least one of the following components. Details on implementing each can be found in the [tutorial page](tutorial.md):
- Model
- Task
- Dataset
- Asset
